# Drupal's .info.yml files allow themers to easily specify some of the static
# properties of your theme. Properties such as its name, libraries of style
# sheets and javascripts, and block regions.

# Drupal 8 stores a cache of the data in this .info.yml files. If you modify any
# lines in this file, you MUST refresh Drupal 8's cache. You can do this with
